Write a report that explains how you designed your code to implement gradient descent for functions of several variables on the cost function g(a, b). Summarize what you learnt about how the choice of f (x) can affect the performance on the model depending on the data set. 4

I designed two gradient descent funtions. One is to calculate the optimal value for one parameter, and the other is to calculate the optimal values for two parameters. While it is possible to combine these, I kept them seperate as trying to combine them proved difficult. Each one takes the function the implements the deritive of the cost function as a parameter however optionally it can take both the cost function and the approximate deritive function developed during this project and use that instead of the exact deritive.

I learned that it is important to analyze the data carefully so that I can pick the correct, most well matching shape, for the data we are dealing with. For example, linear functions was such as f(x) = ax + b would be a good fit if the data you are dealing with is mostly linear (could be well matched to a simple line). However, if the data looks like more like a parabola, then using a linear function is a not good idea as a line cannot describe well the correct values for the data, maybe mostly at the beginning and the end. For example, when I put the linear function to the second dataset, it seems like my function under estimated the diastolic blood pressure for thoese with cholesterol level less than a normalized value of -1 as well as under estimated for those with cholesterol level above 1.25. For part two, I learned that implementing a quadratic function would be a good fit as the shape is close the data set I was working with. I learned that it is important to assess what data set I'm using and choose the appropriate funciton to create a model that can perform well.
