This one is more stable for gradient descent than the linear data.
I can change the initial conditions much more while still getting
a reasonable line to match the data. However, a line is not a good
fit for this non-linear data.

This one has curve so gradient descent has something to follow. Hence, 
finding a solution is more stable.
